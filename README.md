## Data Mining Course - Articles Classification Project

It also uses the wordcloud library to create an age for each different category of the articles also based on the content.

To install all the dependencies on your virtual environment, run: 
* pip install -r requirements.txt

To run all the classifiers and the WorldCloud script with python 3, run:
